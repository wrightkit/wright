# OPY Semantic Compatibility Manifest — Specification

Status: accepted specification — implemented (#109), extended for named/keyword
argument binding (#110)
Scope: the Wright-owned representation for builtin actions/values, member
functions, signatures, parameter enum domains, enum members, and source
aliases; reference-validated and consumed by the native frontend. The
implementation lives in `crates/wright-opy/src/manifest/` (data in
`data/manifest.json`, probe evidence in `probes/`); this document is the
schema and boundary contract for that data.

## Purpose and boundary

The investigation (#106 inventory) concluded that a machine-readable,
Wright-owned manifest is justified: Wright's parse surface already exceeds its
semantic/compile surface, and the residual `unknown-action`/`unknown-value`/
`unsupported-member` emission gaps are catalog-coverage gaps, not grammar gaps.
The manifest replaces the hardcoded `KNOWN_ENUMS` table in
`crates/wright-opy/src/lower.rs` with data and gives the frontend a single,
reference-validated source for:

* builtin actions and values (generic and member);
* member-function metadata (receiver + argument signatures);
* signatures, argument names/order, and defaults;
* parameter enum domains (`Invis`, `Status`, `Transform`, `Throttle`, …);
* enum members per domain;
* source aliases (non-contextual rewrites such as `stopChasingVariable`).

It is **language-compatibility metadata**, distinct from:

* the `workshop-rs` catalog (`crates/workshop-rs/src/catalog/data/catalog.json`,
  consumed via the `wright-workshop` adapter) — the Workshop
  emission/localization layer (en-US spellings, emitter output); the manifest
  links to it by canonical id (`catalogId`) rather than duplicating spellings;
  and
* issue #96's runtime content registry (heroes/maps/abilities content data,
  extension boundaries, independent version identities) — deferred; this
  investigation found no architecture trigger that requires reopening #96.

```

Entry semantics:

* `kind` — `action`/`value` are generic builtins; `memberAction`/`memberValue`
  are receiver methods whose `params` are the **explicit** arguments (the
  receiver is separate). The frontend enforces action/value position
  (`value-in-action-position`, `action-in-value-position`).
* `receiver` — the declared receiver category. `Player` is metadata for
  player-oriented members (the pinned reference does not type-check those
  receivers, so the frontend accepts any receiver); `Variable` and `String`
  are enforced where the reference semantics are clear (`.append` requires an
  assignable receiver, `.format` a string literal).
* `params` — ordered arguments. Arity is `(first defaulted/optional param
  index, params.len())`; `"optional": true` marks an omittable argument
  without an emitted expansion, `"default"` an expansion value. Only
  enum-member defaults are expanded at lowering (e.g. `chaseOverTime(g, 10,
  3)` fills `DESTINATION_AND_DURATION`, matching the reference emission).
  `"unbounded": true` (`.format` placeholders) accepts any argument count.
  Named/keyword argument binding (issue #110) consumes these parameter names
  directly — they are the reference's declared parameter names (e.g. `wait`
  binds `time`/`waitBehavior`, `print` binds `text`, `len` binds `array`):
  * `"keywordOnly": true` — the argument must be passed as `name = expr`
    (the reference `chase` form requires its 3rd argument to be
    `rate = ...` or `duration = ...`);
  * `"positionalOnly": true` — keyword binding is rejected for this
    parameter (the `chase` form's leading arguments);
  * `"alternateNames": [...]` — additional accepted keyword spellings
    (`chase` accepts both `rate` and `duration` for its 3rd parameter);
  * `"variable": true` — the argument must be a variable reference (a
    `globalvar` or a `playervar`); the chase family requires a variable
    first argument to select the global/player emission form.
* `keywordArgs` — whether the entry accepts keyword arguments at all;
  defaults to `true` (the pinned reference's generic binder applies to
  every workshop function). Entries the reference routes around that
  mechanism declare `"keywordArgs": false` (`range`, `random.*`,
  `.format`).
* `contextualDomain` — the `chase` dispatch record: a merged enum domain
  (`ChaseReeval`) that has no standalone member list and resolves **only**
  within this entry's signature context, selected by the keyword spelling
  bound to the `by` parameter. Each option maps a keyword spelling to the
  concrete enum domain and the function the call lowers to (`rate` →
  `ChaseRateReeval` / `chaseAtRate`; `duration` → `ChaseTimeReeval` /
  `chaseOverTime`). The contextual domain is deliberately *not* a declared
  enum domain: a bare `ChaseReeval.MEMBER` outside the `chase` signature is
  rejected like the reference rejects it.
* `context` — a call-context restriction; `"forIterable"` (`range`) is only
  valid as a `for ... in` iterable.
* `catalogId` — the canonical Workshop emission catalog id; absent for
  special emission forms (`debug`/`print`, `append` via Modify) or emission
  surfaces not yet catalog-covered (documented gaps).
* `evidence` — every entry must reference at least one probe recording
  oracle acceptance (deterministic `check` failure otherwise).

Entries carry the minimal semantic data the frontend needs to resolve names,
check arity, resolve enum domains, and lower; they deliberately omit upstream
description/localization text.

## Data provenance and licensing rule

The manifest is **Wright-authored data validated against observed oracle
behavior** — the same evidence path used by the chase-enums fixtures and the
catalog update pipeline in `workshop-rs`. It must not be produced by
mechanically converting OverPy's GPL-3.0 TypeScript data files
(`src/data/*.ts`) into the manifest: ADR-0004 and `docs/licensing.md` forbid
importing OverPy implementation details into the core, and observed behavior
through documented compatibility tests is the permitted input. Every entry
records the reference probe that validates it (`probes/probes.json` carries
the probe source hash, expected oracle status, normalized emission hash, and
— for rejections — the diagnostic category fragment).

## Validation rules (implemented pipeline)

* `Manifest::load` (`crates/wright-opy/src/manifest`) — schema validation,
  duplicate/colliding ids, colliding or missing aliases, undeclared enum
  domains, undeclared enum-default members, keyword-binding data sanity
  (`keywordOnly`/`positionalOnly` are mutually exclusive, alternate
  spellings do not collide with other parameters), contextual-domain
  integrity (the contextual domain is not a declared enum domain, the
  selector parameter exists and its keyword spellings cover the options,
  every option domain is declared), and entries lacking oracle evidence all
  fail deterministically (mirroring the canonical-catalog validation in
  `workshop-rs`); a
  canonical-rewrite test pins the data file to its byte-canonical form, and a
  cross-check test pins every `catalogId` (and contextual option target) to
  the Workshop emission catalog.
* `probes/validate.py` — reference validation: every probe runs against the
  pinned oracle and must match its recorded accept/reject, normalized
  emission hash, and diagnostic category (S/D level, see the #106 planning
  comment); wired into the compatibility harness test suite
  (`compatibility/tests/test_manifest_probes.py`).
* The frontend consumes the manifest in `lower.rs`: unknown names, wrong
  action/value position, invalid arity, invalid receiver category,
  enum-domain mismatches, and named/keyword argument binding
  (`unknown-keyword`, `duplicate-argument`, `missing-argument`,
  `positional-after-keyword`, `keyword-required`, `keyword-unsupported`,
  `invalid-argument`) produce structured, source-located frontend
  diagnostics before Workshop emission.

## Consumers

* `wright-opy` — name/member/enum resolution, arity and signature checks,
  `KNOWN_ENUMS` absorption, earlier resolution of unknown-action/value errors
  (addressing the diagnostic-provenance limitation);
* `wright-workshop` (adapter over `workshop-rs`) — canonical-id linkage to
  the emission catalog (validated by the cross-check test);
* differential and systematic reference tests (the probe validator);
* documentation, agents, and future release metadata can consume the same
  declared boundary.

## Non-goals

* A runtime-downloadable or hot-updating content registry (#96).
* Workshop content data (heroes/abilities/maps) as manifest entries.
* Contextual aliases beyond the manifest's declared data, raw-Workshop enum
  resolution beyond the declared contextual domains (#111), and further
  named-argument shapes without reference/corpus evidence.
* Preserving upstream implementation structure for its own sake.
